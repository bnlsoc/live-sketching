To use this, just download the entire repository in a zip folder, right click, extract here. Double click on the Live_Sketch.exe. It may or may not ask for camera permission, if it asks, allow it. You will see a window containing your sketch and will dynamically change to what appears in front of the camera. The moment you press enter, your sketch will be saved within the same directory.

The application was written in pythom and the python code has also been attached.
